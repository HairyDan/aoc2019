attempt to do advent of code 2019 with a different language every day

this was a bad idea

this will be bad

PLAN:
* set up (at least some) languages in advance with fizzbuzz
* do harder languages first (while the questions are easier)

language order and how to compile/run:
<ol>
<li>haskell; ghc 1.hs, ./1</li>
<li>ocaml; ocamlopt -o progprog 2.ml, ./progprog</li>
</ol>
